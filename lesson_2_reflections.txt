What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A `.git/` directory is created and it's needed for git operations in background.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area saves local changes and could be modified or reverted. The value is that this area prepare the files to be commited or that I want to be commited.
